# AI-Driven-Robot-Simulation

## About
The AI code can be found in my "Markov-Decision-Proces" repo
Robotics code can be found in this repo

For the AI part we used Markov Decision Proces (MDP). 
For the robotics part we used a simulated robot using gazebo and Robotics OS (ROS). This python script uses a generated .csv file that the AI script makes after training the model.

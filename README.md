## About
The AI code can be found in my "" repo
Robotics code can be found in this repo

For the AI part we used Markov Decision Proces (MDP). 
For the robotics part we used a simulated robot using gazebo and Robotics OS (ROS). This python script uses a generated .csv file that the AI script makes after training the model.
